# Ads vs Sales Prediction

This machine learning project explores how advertising budgets across different channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper) impact product sales. A linear regression model is trained to predict sales based on advertising spend.

##  Dataset Description

The dataset has 4 columns:
- `TV`: Ad budget spent on TV (in thousands of dollars)
- `Radio`: Ad budget spent on Radio
- `Newspaper`: Ad budget spent on Newspaper
- `Sales`: Number of units sold (target)

## Whatâ€™s in the Jupyter Notebook?

- âœ… Loaded and explored the dataset with Pandas
- ðŸ“Š Visualized feature relationships using Seaborn pair plots and correlation heatmaps
- ðŸ§¼ Performed feature scaling (if needed)
- ðŸ¤– Built a **Linear Regression** model
- ðŸ“ˆ Evaluated the model with RÂ² score and prediction plots

> The model showed a strong correlation between TV + Radio ads and increased sales.

## Streamlit Web App

This app allows users to:
- Input ad budgets (TV, Radio, Newspaper)
- Get instant predicted sales using the trained linear regression model

To run the app:

```bash
Open Anaconda powershell prompt and add path to the file where you saved your streamlit code, you can write your streamlit code in pycharm or in notepad but u need to install pycharm for the code and then give instruction in the powershell prompt as given below.
streamlit run app.py
